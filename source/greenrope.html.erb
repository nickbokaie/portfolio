        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>During my time at GreenRope, my primary focus was addressing design consistency throughout the platform. When moving through the platform, there was a disconnect between feature areas which would lead to user frustrations. The main objective was to identify the various differences from feature to feature and implement a new design to eliminate any disjunction.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Due to a limited development staff, we didnâ€™t have the resources to roll out a global styling update. We had to approach our design refresh feature by feature. This decision led to several challenges:
            <ul>
                <li>We had to balance our Feature Request / Todo List with our design refresh.</li>
                <li>Prioritizing and coordinating with the development staff to incorporate feature and design improvements. </li>
                <li><span style="font-weight: 700;">Being conscious of providing a fresh feel without creating a jarring experience between features.</span> As tempting as it was to implement a bold design, I had to be conscious of not falling into the same habits I was trying to eliminate.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Deep Dive: Dashboard</h2>
        <p>I felt an appropriate area to begin our design update was our dashboard. Like most dashboards, the main focus was to aggregate and provide the user the necessary data overview. Seeing as this is the first landing point for all users, I wanted this area to set the standard and tone for the rest of the UI.</p>
        <h3>UX Process | Audit</h3>
        <p>During our review of the current dashboard, I first cross referenced any feature request tickets we had to give myself a more wholesome foundation to approach the redesign. After taking those requests into consideration, I then began to create a few user personas to best understand the wants and needs of our user base. After reviewing with my CEO, we categorized the majority of our users in two sections:
            <ul>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Account Owner:</span> These are the primary account holders. They are able to review all the account activity and data associated with every user they may have.</li>
                <li><span style="font-weight:700">Account User:</span> These users can range from salespersons to marketing specialist. The type of information they view review is relevant to their personal KPIs. </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Deep Dive: Mobile App</h2>
        <p>While the desktop client was receiving a global style update, we found this a good opportunity to revamp our mobile application. Seeing as the mobile had not received any major styling update since its creation several years ago, we found this a good opportunity to create some consistency between the mobile and desktop experiences.</p>
        <h3>Prioritization</h3>
        <p>While the mobile experience was limited in terms of functionality compared to the desktop experience, we decided based on the limited development time to focus on the design first before addressing bigger functionality requests.</p>
